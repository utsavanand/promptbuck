# Explain [TOPIC] Like I'm Ten

Break down **[TOPIC]** for someone with zero technical background. Practical, friendly, no jargon, focused on what this thing actually means for a regular person's life.

## 1. What is it? (The 30 second version)

Explain the core idea in 3 to 5 sentences. Use a physical, tangible analogy from everyday life. No jargon at all. If a 10 year old couldn't follow this, rewrite it.

## 2. How does it actually work?

Walk through the mechanics step by step, the way you would explain how a microwave heats food (not by describing electromagnetic theory, but by saying "it makes the water molecules in your food vibrate really fast, and that vibration creates heat").

- Start from what the user sees or experiences
- Explain what happens behind the scenes in plain language
- Use a numbered sequence: first this happens, then this, then this
- If there is a key concept the reader needs to grasp, define it with "think of it like..." followed by something concrete

## 3. Why should I care?

Answer these directly. No hedging.

- **Does this affect me right now?** If yes, explain exactly how, with a specific situation the reader would recognize. ("Next time you Google something and see a summary at the top instead of a list of links, that is this technology.")
- **Will it affect my job?** Be honest and specific. Name job categories. Don't say "many industries will be impacted." Say which ones and how.
- **Will it affect my money?** Prices, services I pay for, investments, job market. Concrete, not abstract.
- **Will it affect my daily routine?** What will feel different in 2 to 3 years compared to today?

## 4. Real world examples (happening right now)

Give 3 specific, real examples of this technology in use today. For each:

- Name the product or company (real, not hypothetical)
- Describe the user experience in one sentence ("You open the app, type a question, and get...")
- Explain what is happening behind the scenes in 2 to 3 sentences
- Describe what people did before this existed ("Before this, you would have had to...")
- Rate it honestly: does it work well, or is it still rough?

## 5. What is overhyped and what is real

Split this into two clear lists:

**What is real right now:**
- Things this technology genuinely does well today, with evidence

**What is overhyped or not there yet:**
- Things that get talked about a lot but don't actually work reliably, or are years away
- Common misconceptions

Be blunt. If the media coverage is ahead of reality, say so.

## 6. What should I actually do about this?

Practical, tactical advice for a non-technical person:

- Things to try (free tools, apps, features already in products you use)
- Things to watch out for (scams, misleading claims, privacy issues)
- Skills or habits that become more or less valuable
- One thing to do this week to get hands-on experience

## 7. The text message version

Write a single paragraph someone could text to a friend. Conversational, accurate, no hype. Start with "So basically..." and keep it under 100 words.

## Rules

- No jargon unless you define it immediately in plain language
- "Transformative," "revolutionary," "paradigm shift" are all banned. Describe what it does, not how impressive it is.
- Be honest about limitations. If something is overhyped, say so.
- Use concrete numbers, dates, and product names when possible
- Every claim should be grounded in something real
- If something is uncertain, say "nobody knows yet" rather than presenting one side as fact
- Vary your sentence length. Short sentences are fine. They are good, actually.
- Do not write like a press release or a LinkedIn post
