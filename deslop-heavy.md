# De-Slop: Heavy

Rewrite the following document so it reads like it was written by a real person, not by an AI. Do not change the meaning, structure, or factual content. Only fix the writing style. Preserve the author's voice and register. A formal, precise sentence is not the same as an AI-sounding sentence. Do not flatten deliberate word choices into generic simpler ones.

**Remove these AI writing patterns:**

1. **Dashes.** No em dashes or en dashes. Restructure using commas, colons, periods, parentheses, or split into two sentences.

2. **Emojis.** Remove all emojis. If an emoji was used as a visual marker or label, replace with plain text or remove entirely.

3. **Banned words.** Replace these with plain alternatives: "delve", "tapestry", "robust", "seamless", "holistic", "synergy", "paradigm", "elevate", "foster", "navigate (complexity)", "unlock", "empower", "streamline", "cutting-edge", "game-changer", "deep dive", "multifaceted", "pivotal", "nuanced", "underscores".

4. **Banned phrases.** Remove or rephrase: "at its core", "it's worth noting that", "in today's rapidly evolving", "the landscape of", "a testament to", "let's unpack", "moreover", "furthermore", "in conclusion", "plays a crucial role", "is poised to", "it is important to note that".

5. **Emotional inflation.** Don't call things "exciting", "remarkable", "invaluable", "transformative", or "game-changing" unless the context genuinely warrants it. Prefer flat, factual descriptions.

6. **Sentence rhythm.** AI writes sentences of uniform length (15-20 words each). Break this up. Mix short sentences with longer ones. Let some thoughts be 5 words. Let others run with clauses.

7. **Predictable structure.** AI loves: "topic sentence, three supporting points, summary sentence." Real writing doesn't follow this template in every paragraph. Some paragraphs are one sentence. Some jump into the point without preamble. Remove any paragraph that just restates what the previous one said.

8. **Hedging and filler.** Remove unnecessary qualifiers: "It is important to note that", "One might argue", "This is particularly relevant because", "As we can see". Just say the thing.

9. **Forced transitions.** Remove connective tissue that exists only to sound smooth: "Building on this", "With that in mind", "Taking a step back", "That said". If the next idea follows logically, you don't need a bridge.

10. **Over-explaining.** AI restates concepts the reader already understood. If a point is clear, move on. Don't add a sentence explaining what you just said.

11. **Lists of three.** AI defaults to grouping things in threes ("speed, reliability, and scalability"). Real writing doesn't always do this. Use the actual number of items, even if it's two or four.

12. **Perfect parallel structure everywhere.** AI makes every list item and every heading follow the exact same grammatical pattern. Real writing varies this naturally.

13. **Corporate voice.** If it sounds like a press release or a LinkedIn post, rewrite it to sound like one person explaining something to another person.

**Rules:**
- Keep the same document structure (headings, sections, bullets, tables)
- Keep all factual content intact
- Don't add humor or personality that isn't there, just remove the AI sheen
- Don't make it worse by going too casual. Match the formality level of the content
- If a sentence is already fine, leave it alone
- Preserve the author's voice and register. A formal, precise sentence is not slop. Do not flatten deliberate word choices into generic simpler ones. If the original says "principled" or "intentional", keep those words.
