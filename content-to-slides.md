# Content to Slides

Turn the following content into a slide deck outline. Each slide should have two parts: what goes ON the slide (what the audience reads) and what I SAY over the slide (speaker notes).

## The content

**[PASTE YOUR CONTENT, STUDY GUIDE, NOTES, OR SOURCE MATERIAL HERE]**

## Target audience

**[WHO IS THIS PRESENTATION FOR? e.g., "engineering team," "non-technical execs," "conference audience," "college class"]**

## Approximate length

**[HOW MANY MINUTES? e.g., "15 minutes" or "30 minutes"]**

## How to structure the deck

### Opening slide
- Title and one-line subtitle that frames what this talk is about
- Speaker notes: how I introduce the topic in 30 seconds. No "today we're going to talk about..." Just start with why this matters or a surprising fact.

### For each content slide

**On the slide:**
- A short headline (not a topic label, a point. Not "Market Overview" but "The market doubled in 3 years")
- 3 to 5 bullets OR a single visual/table/diagram description. Never both.
- Each bullet is one line, 8 words max. The slide is a visual anchor, not a document.
- If a number or data point exists, lead with it. "47% of teams" not "Many teams"

**Speaker notes:**
- 3 to 6 sentences of what I actually say while this slide is up
- Written in spoken language, not written language. Short sentences. Conversational.
- Include the context, the story, the "why" behind what's on the slide
- Include transitions: how I move from this point to the next slide
- If there's an anecdote, example, or analogy that makes this point land, include it here

### Section breaks
- If the content naturally divides into 2 to 4 major sections, add a section divider slide with just the section title and a one-sentence framing
- Speaker notes for section breaks: one sentence transition from previous section

### Closing slide
- The single takeaway. One sentence.
- Speaker notes: how I wrap up. What I want the audience to walk away thinking about. No "in conclusion." Just the point.

## Rules

- The slide content and the speaker notes should NOT say the same thing. The slide is the anchor. The notes are the explanation. If I'm just reading my slides out loud, the deck is wrong.
- Aim for one slide per 1 to 2 minutes of speaking time
- Not every piece of source content deserves a slide. Cut aggressively. If something is interesting but not essential to the point, leave it for Q&A.
- Group related ideas. Three separate slides about related sub-points should probably be one slide with three bullets.
- Prefer concrete over abstract. If the source material says "there are several approaches," the slide should name them.
- If the source material contains data, put the data on the slide and the interpretation in the speaker notes.
- Do not add content that is not in the source material. Restructure and compress, do not invent.
- Speaker notes should sound like a real person talking, not like a textbook. Read them out loud in your head. If they sound stiff, rewrite them.
