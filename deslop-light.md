# De-Slop: Light

Rewrite the following document to remove obvious AI-generated tells. Do not change the meaning, structure, tone, or factual content. Do not simplify the writing or lower the register. The goal is to make it pass as human-written, not to make it casual.

**Remove:**

1. **Dashes.** No em dashes or en dashes. Restructure using commas, colons, periods, parentheses, or split into two sentences.

2. **Emojis.** Remove all emojis. If an emoji was used as a visual marker or label, replace with plain text or remove entirely.

3. **Banned words.** Replace these with plain alternatives: "delve", "tapestry", "robust", "seamless", "holistic", "synergy", "paradigm", "elevate", "foster", "navigate (complexity)", "unlock", "empower", "streamline", "cutting-edge", "game-changer", "deep dive", "multifaceted", "pivotal", "nuanced", "underscores".

4. **Banned phrases.** Remove or rephrase: "at its core", "it's worth noting that", "in today's rapidly evolving", "the landscape of", "a testament to", "let's unpack", "moreover", "furthermore", "in conclusion", "plays a crucial role", "is poised to", "it is important to note that".

5. **Emotional inflation.** Don't call things "exciting", "remarkable", "invaluable", "transformative", or "game-changing" unless the context genuinely warrants it. Prefer flat, factual descriptions.

**Rules:**
- Keep the same document structure (headings, sections, bullets, tables)
- Keep all factual content intact
- Preserve the author's voice and register. Formal, precise writing is not slop.
- If a sentence is already fine, leave it alone
- Do not rewrite sentences that don't have any of the above problems
